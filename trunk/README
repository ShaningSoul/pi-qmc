Important configure flags:

--with-ndim=NDIM
 
  Lets you compile the code for 1, 2, 3 or 4 dimensional
  simulations. (Four dimensional simulations are mostly
  used for testing spin algorithms or other mathematical
  models.) 

--enable-mpi

  Enable's MPI for parallel simulation.

--enable-sprng

  Use the SPRNG library for random numbers.

If configure have trouble locating the proper blas
