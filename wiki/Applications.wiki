In this work, we use path integral quantum Monte Carlo to study condensation of electron-hole pairs in bilayer graphene. Within the assumptions of our model, we find a transition temperature well above room temperature. The article describes some background on the bilayer graphene systems and explains how path integrals reveal excitonic pairing and excitonic superfluidity.

Essentially, this problem involves the simulation of an excitonic condensate with fixed-node
path integral Monte Carlo. Simulation of an idealized exicitonic condensate in three-dimensions
was the topic of John Shumway's 1999 Ph. D. dissertation (<a href="http://physics.asu.edu/shumway/papers/shumwaydis.pdf">Quantum Monte 
Carlo Simulations of Electrons and Holes, pdf download, 792 KB</a>).

Our work developing the *_pi_* code began with applications to self-assembled quantum dots.
In addition to the path integral Monte Carlo algorithm, we have build a set of tools (http://code.google.com/p/qdot-tools) for accurately
modeling the confinement potentials of self-assembled nanostructures, starting from a
given size, shape, and composition profile.


In a project with experimentalist Dr. Sutharsan Ketharanath and Prof. Jeff Drucker, we studied the problem of how many electrons sit in an n-doped Ge/Si quantum dot. The paper, “Electron charging in epitaxial Ge quantum dots on Si(001),” <a href="http://link.aip.org/link/?JAPIAU/105/044312/1">J. Appl Phys. 105, 044312 (2009)</a>, describes Sutha's experiments, where he measured C-V curves while depleting charge from Ge huts and domes in his gated quantum dot sample. Sourabh provided quantum dot modeling that shows that domes have much wider and deeper confinement potentials than smaller pyramidal dots.
