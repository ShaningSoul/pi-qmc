#summary How to build and install the pi program

= Introduction =


The easiest way to build is to use:
{{{
./configure
make
}}}

For a parallel build
{{{
./configure --enable-mpi MPICXX=mpic++ MPICC=mpicc MPIF77=mpif77
}}}
where you should use the names of your MPI enabled compilers.

You can also build for different numbers of physical dimensions (default is NDIM=3)
{{{
./configure --with-ndim=2
}}}

= Required libraries =
We use the following libraries in the *_pi_* code:
  * [http://xmlsoft.org/ libxml2]
  * [http://www.oonumerics.org/blitz/ blitz++]
  * [http://www.hdfgroup.org/ hdf5]
  * [http://www.fftw.org/ fftw3]
  * BLAS/LAPACK
  * [http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ gsl]

= Advanced build using multiple directories=

In research, we often want different versions of the executables, for example, versions with and
without MPI, or versions compiled for two-dimensional systems. To accomplish this, we make 
a <tt>pibuilds</tt> directory beside our svn checkout directory (<tt>pi</tt> or <tt>pi-qmc</tt>).
We then make empty subdirectories for each build, for example <tt>ndim2mpi</tt> for a two
dimensional MPI version. A typical directory structure is:

{{{
codes/
  pi-qmc/
    configure
    src/
    lib/
  pibuilds/
    ndim1/
    ndim2/
    ndim3/
    ndim1mpi/
    ndim2mpi/
    ndim3mpi/
    debug/
}}}

To build, go into the empty build directory,
<code language="sh">
cd ~/codes/pibuilds/ndim2mpi
</code>
Then run the configure script with the desired options
<code language="sh">
../../configure --with-ndim=2 --enable-mpi
</code>
You will probably want more configure options; see the platform specific instructions
below for some examples.

Then, make the code in that directory,
<code language="sh">
make -j2
</code>

For conveniance, you can make a soft link to the executable
<code language="sh">
ln -sf ~/codes/pibuilds/ndim3mpi ~/bin/pi2Dmpi
</code>
